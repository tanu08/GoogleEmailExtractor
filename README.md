# GoogleEmailExtractor

Scrape Google+ Communities page and extract Email-IDs of the members who are following that community page.

**How it works**

The extension loads on any Google+ community page (https://plus.google.com/communities/* urls), and on clicking the Extension Icon 
in the toolbar, it shows a button to "Extract emails".
On clicking Extract emails button, the extension starts the processing & scraping of community members in the background.
The Extension's popup dialog will show the progress of the extraction job.
Upon completion of the extraction, it'll show a "Copy to clipboard" button. 
Click it and all email addresses of members get copied to the clipboard, ready to be saved anywhere you like!
